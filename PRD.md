Product Requirements Document: Local AI Agent ToolVersion: 1.0 (MVP)Date: 2025-09-301. OverviewThis document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Local AI Agent Tool. The core purpose of this product is to provide users with a secure, private, and highly customizable interface for interacting with local Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary differentiator is the ability for users to define and manage specialized "agents" through simple instruction files.2. Target Audience & User StoriesTarget AudiencePrimary: Technologically savvy users (developers, researchers, AI enthusiasts) who are comfortable setting up and running local LLMs (via Ollama) and value data privacy and deep customization.Secondary: Power users (writers, analysts, lawyers) who need specialized tools for their workflows and are willing to learn a new application to gain an edge.Key User Stories for MVPAs a user, I want to connect the application to my running Ollama instance so that I can leverage my own local models.As a user, I want to create a new agent by uploading a .txt file containing its system prompt and instructions.As a user, I want to select from a list of my available local models to power the current agent.As a user, I want to have a conversation with my selected agent in a clean, intuitive chat interface.As a user, I want to easily switch between my saved agents to perform different tasks.3. Features & ScopeIn-Scope for MVP v1.0The focus of the MVP is to deliver a stable and functional version of the core agent workflow.|| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Priority || FE-01 | Ollama Connection Status | The UI must clearly indicate if it is successfully connected to the local Ollama server. | Must-Have || FE-02 | Agent Management | Users can create new agents and switch between a list of existing agents. For the MVP, agent state will be managed locally in the browser/app. | Must-Have || FE-03 | Instruction File Upload | Users can define an agent by uploading a .txt file. The content of this file will be used as the system prompt. | Must-Have || FE-04 | Model Selection | A dropdown will be populated with the list of models available from the user's Ollama instance. | Must-Have || FE-05 | Chat Interface | A standard chat interface for sending prompts and receiving responses from the selected agent. | Must-Have || FE-06 | Code Rendering | The chat interface must properly render code blocks with syntax highlighting and a "copy" button. | Must-Have |Out-of-Scope for MVP v1.0These features are valuable but will be considered for future releases to ensure the MVP remains focused.| Feature Name | Reason for Exclusion | Target Release || Data Export | Not essential for core functionality validation. | v1.1 (Fast Follow) || Artifact Upload (RAG) | High complexity and significant security risks. Requires a dedicated development cycle. | v2.0 || Cloud Sync/Backup | Increases complexity (auth, database). The MVP is a local-first tool. | Future Release || Agent Marketplace/Sharing | Community/platform feature, requires backend infrastructure. | Future Release || Advanced Chat Features | (e.g., editing messages, forking conversations) - UI complexity not needed for MVP. | Future Release |4. Technical RequirementsFramework: Next.js with TypeScriptStyling: Tailwind CSSLocal LLM Interface: The application will interface with an Ollama server running on the user's local machine. The MVP will not be responsible for installing or managing Ollama.Deployment Target: Web application (for initial development and testing).Desktop Portability (Post-MVP): The Next.js application should be structured in a way that facilitates future packaging with Electron.5. Security ConsiderationsNo Server-Side Data Storage: All user data (chats, instructions) will be stored on the client-side for the MVP to maximize privacy.API Calls: All communication with Ollama is performed on the user's local network. No data is sent to external servers.Input Sanitization: While the primary user is trusted, all inputs should be treated with caution to prevent potential rendering issues or XSS in the UI.
